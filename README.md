# ACG-Project-Resume-Azure

Welcome to my personal resume project! In this project, I built a resume webpage hosted on Microsoft Azure, using Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and CosmosDB. The webpage is designed with HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, education, and experience.

## Features

- **Static Resume Webpage**: Built using HTML and CSS for a clean and simple design.
- **CI/CD Workflow**: Integrated with GitHub for version control and automated deployments.
- **Azure Hosting**: Deployed on Microsoft Azure using Blob Storage and Azure Functions.
- **Serverless Database**: Uses CosmosDB for dynamic content storage in a serverless setup.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML & CSS** for front-end design
- **GitHub** for version control and CI/CD pipeline
- **Microsoft Azure** for hosting and serverless architecture
  - **Blob Storage** for static files
  - **Azure Functions** for serverless logic
  - **CosmosDB** for dynamic, serverless database
